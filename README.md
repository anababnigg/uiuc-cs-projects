## About:

**Languages used:** C++, Java

Java was utilized in couse CS124. I am yet to push code from this course to this repository. C++ was utilized in both CS128 and CS225. In these courses, "MP" stands for "Machine Project". Most of these projects and their descriptions are posted on the university websites, yet I will provide explanations below. 

## Project Descriptions

**CS 128:**
> **"Hawaiian Words"**: a tool for generating the pronunciation of Hawaiian words by defining the pronunciation rules for each character and combination of characters in the language.

> **"Connect 4"**: program for simulating a variant of a 'Connect Four' board game, where functions provide the functionality needed to simulate and play the board game. 

> **"Mountain Paths":** This program takes elevation data from a file and generates a ppm image file showing the shortest path from one side to the other. Red lines indicate the shortest path from a specified starting position, while a green line marks the overall shortest path. Inputs include image dimensions (rows and columns in pixels) and the data file name.

> **"Seam Carving":** This program implements a Seam Carving algorithm that allows for resizing images by intelligently removing seams with low energy, preserving the important features of the image.

> **"Naive Databases":** This code implements a naive in-memory database system that allows for the creation, management, and manipulation of tables with various data types and rows, providing basic functionality for database operations.

> **"DNA Strand":** program that provides functionality to represent, manipulate, and splice DNA strands represented as linked lists of characters. 

> **"Cord":** This code defines a data structure called Cord, which represents a string implemented as a binary tree. The Cord class provides methods for creating and manipulating instances of this data structure


## Notes

- Most of this coursework was done over my time at university, yet I am pushing changes recently.
- Currently taking CS225 and thus the repository is incomplete in this realm.
