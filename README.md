## About:

**Languages used:** C++, Java

Java was utilized in couse CS124. I am yet to push code from this course to this repository. C++ was utilized in both CS128 and CS225. In these courses, "MP" stands for "Machine Project". Most of these projects and their descriptions are posted on the university websites, yet I will provide explanations below. 

## Project Descriptions

**CS 128:**
> "Hawaiian Words": a tool for generating the pronunciation of Hawaiian words by defining the pronunciation rules for each character and combination of characters in the language.
> "Connect 4": program for simulating a variant of a 'Connect Four' board game, where functions provide the functionality needed to simulate and play the board game. 



## Notes

- Most of this coursework was done over my time at university, yet I am pushing changes recently.
- Currently taking CS225 and thus the repository is incomplete in this realm.
